/**
 * Get the API base URL for making backend requests
 * 
 * Priority:
 * 1. NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL environment variable (if set) - RECOMMENDED for production
 * 2. Try to infer from current location for common deployment patterns
 * 3. Default to localhost:5050 for local development
 * 
 * For production deployments, it's strongly recommended to set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL.
 * 
 * Common deployment patterns:
 * - Single domain with Next.js rewrites: Set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="" (empty string)
 *   Backend routes (/auth/*, /v1/*) will be proxied by Next.js to the backend
 * - Separate subdomains: Set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
 * - CapRover/separate apps: Set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://backend-app.your-domain.com
 * - Same host, different port: Will auto-detect if frontend is on non-standard port
 * 
 * When NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is not set:
 * - For localhost: defaults to http://localhost:5050 (standard backend dev port)
 * - For deployed sites on custom port: tries backend on port 5050 (uncommon but supported)
 * - For deployed sites on standard ports: returns empty string to use Next.js rewrites
 * 
 * @returns {string} The API base URL
